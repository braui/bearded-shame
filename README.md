# Bearded Shame

*Nothing against beards, blame Github for suggesting that title*

### What is this? What am I doing here?

2 things.

#### 1st, Fork this repository and submit a pull request.

This application is designed to gauge a PayrollHero applicant's:

* familiarity with code patterns,
* adherence to best practices,
* ability to write tests and documentation, and
* command of Ruby and Rails as a whole

You (we mean the prospective developer candidate) will submit a pull request to this repository containing any refactorings, tests, documentation, and improvements to demonstrate your skills and experience.

#### 2nd, there is a file named `questions.txt` on the first level directory of this repository.

Answer those questions by **modifying the file itself** in this format:

```
1. What is the answer to the Ultiate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everyting?

- 42
```

### Alright, so what is this application supposed to do?

People have beards. Sometimes you need it trimmed, other times you need it shaved. This application tracks who those people are and whether they want one or the other.

And also sometimes people like massages too I hear. Maybe track those as well.

Feel free to add a way to create new users. We've included a rake task somewhere in there that'll give you a preliminary list of users to play with. We'll let you figure out how to get that thing running

### Got it, are there rules to this?

* Any tests added must pass, coverage is up to you.
* The people reviewing your PR will be evaluating your code. New gems are permitted but it is encouraged you write your own stuff.
* The following specifications must be met:
  * The application **MUST** run.
  * It must track who has been shaved, trimmed and/or massaged.
  * The status of each entity must be changeable.
* Any other feature will be considered "fluff" *(ie: don't bother adding a search function)*.

Aside from that, anything goes.

### General tips:

* Quality over quantity.
* Don't forget your fundamentals. MVC and Rest are Best practices for a reason.
* **However**, implementing a (decent) SPA will net you bons points.
* We do not necessarilly require TDD, though proving your application does what t's supposed to without us having to
boot it up will also net you bonus points (hint: *acceptance*).
* Don't be afraid to remove stuff.

# Good luck!
