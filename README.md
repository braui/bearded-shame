# Bearded Shame

*Nothing against beards, blame Github for suggesting that title*

### What is this? What am I doing here?

This application is designed to gauge a PayrollHero applicant's:

* familiarity with code patterns, 
* adherence to best practices,
* ability to write tests and documentation, and
* command of Ruby and Rails as a whole

You (we mean the prospective developer candidate) will submit a pull request to this repository containing any refactorings, tests, documentation, and improvements to demonstrate your skills and experience.

### Alright, so what is this application supposed to do?

People have beards. Sometimes you need it trimed, other times you need it shaved. This application tracks who those people are and whether they want one or the other. 

And also sometimes people like massages too I hear. Maybe track those as well.

Feel free to add a way to create new users. We've included a rake task somewhere in there that'll give you a preliminary list of users to play with. We'll let you figure out how to get that thing running. 

### Got it, are there rules to this?

* Well first, get the app running.
* Any tests added must pass, coverage is up to you.
* The people reviewing your PR will be evaluating your code. New gems are permitted but it is encouraged you write your own stuff.

Aside from that, anything goes. As long as the application is able to know who's shaved, trimmed or massaged, you're golden.

### General tips:

* Quality over quantity.
* Don't forget your fundamentals. MVC and Rest are Best practices for a reason.
* TDD is optional, though nothing demonstrates good testing than if you can prove your application does what it's supposed to (*cough integrations *cough), 
* Don't be afraid to remove stuff.


# Good luck!
